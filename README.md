## Before Starting
1. Configure a venv from this project, use python 3.12

    ```bash
    pip3 install -r requirements.txt
    pip3 install pre-commit
    pre-commit install
    ```
   This is going to make sure the code is linted and formatted before committing changes

## Commiting Code
1. After making your changes, ruff runs as a pre-commit script to catch static bugs
2. Some of the mistakes are fixable by ruff, so run the commit commands couple of times
